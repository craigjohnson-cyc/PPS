 2nd rewrite - .Net Core C#  Rest API's
 UI's: MVC
       Blazor
       Angular

I must remember that this rewrite is just a practice exercise!
I had to take a brek due to frustration with the poorly designed
DataBase.  There is NO way this can become a product without a complete
redesign.  Too many tables where columns were added instead of a new
table.  Ex Acct1, Acct2, Acct3, Acct4   First client with more than 4
accounts breaks the application.

Additionally, I have lost track of the original FoxPro code,
which would anwser multiple questions, such as "What exactly does 
this screen do?"  Therefor, this will be based on the 1st rewrite
(VB.Net code) which was never completed either.
